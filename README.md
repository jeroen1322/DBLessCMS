# DBLessCMS
Takes JSON data to display "articles". I started this 'project' when I started learning PHP but never finished it. 
But I had some spare time and wanted to fix it. Now it works! 

First the PHP gets content of 'articles.json'. Then it will use json_decode to get the JSON data and convert it to an array.
Then the array will be displayed in an "article format". 

It is really simple, but it was fun to finish something that I started a long time ago.
